<p><strong>Installing the starting files:&nbsp;</strong>Download and unzip this folder:&nbsp;<a href="Unity-AI-book-Chapter02-starting-files.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity-AI-book-Chapter02-starting-files.zip</a>. In Unity Hub choose "Add" &gt; "Add project from disk" and select the unzipped folder.&nbsp; If a warning says "To open this project, install the missing Editor version or open it with another version" click "Choose another Editor version" and choose <strong>your editor, NOT the original one</strong>. Each time it double-checks that you "really want to change editors," agree. It should open fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instructions are in the book at <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unity-artificial-intelligence/9781803238531/B17984_02_Epub.xhtml#_idParaDest-48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unity-artificial-intelligence/9781803238531/B17984_02_Epub.xhtml#_idParaDest-48</a>. THE FILES ARE NEARLY DONE [A LOT MORE IS DONE THAN THE BOOK SAYS] Here's all you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Chapter 2 project</li>
<li>From Assets &gt; Scenes, open the scene “SimpleFSM.”</li>
<li>With PlayerTank selected in the Hierarchy, notice in the Inspector the <strong>PlayerTankController script</strong> is attached to the PlayerTank. (It’s also in the Assets &gt; Scripts &gt; Misc folder.) <strong>Drag and drop Turret</strong> from the Hierarchy into the corresponding fields of the PlayerTankController script in the Inspector.</li>
<li>Still looking in the Inspector at the PlayerTankController script, <strong>drag the Bullet</strong> Prefab from Assets &gt; Resources &gt; Prefabs into the script field for it.</li>
<li>Selecting each enemy Tank one by one in the Hierarchy, look in the Inspector at the <strong>SimpleFSM</strong> attached to the Tank. <strong>Drag the Bullet</strong> Prefab from Assets &gt; Resources &gt; Prefabs into the script field for it.</li>
<li>Select the Bullet Prefab from Assets &gt; Resources &gt; Prefabs and look at its <strong>Bullet Script</strong> in the Inspector. From Assets &gt; Particle Effects, drag <strong>ParticleExplosion</strong> into the script field for it.</li>
