<p>Since the starting files above do not include a project file, I made a new empty 3D project, then in my Assets folder I deleted the existing Scripts folder and dragged the contents of the downloaded Assets folder (but not the Assets folder itself) into my Assets folder in the Project view.</p>
<!-- <p>When opening this folder in Unity, if it says "To open this project, install the missing Editor version or open it with another version" click "Choose another Editor version" and choose your editor. Each time it double-checks that you really want to change editors, agree. It should open fine.</p> -->
<p>Instructions are in the book at <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unity-artificial-intelligence/9781803238531/B17984_04_Epub.xhtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unity-artificial-intelligence/9781803238531/B17984_04_Epub.xhtml</a>. THE FILES ARE NEARLY DONE [A LOT MORE IS DONE THAN THE BOOK SAYS] Here's all you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Chapter 4 project</li>
<li>From Assets &gt; Scenes, open the scene “<strong>Demo</strong>.”</li>
<li>With <strong>AI_Character </strong>(red enemy tank) selected in the Hierarchy, notice in the Inspector it has a <strong>Box Collider</strong> component (it fits snugly around the red tank). You have to check the checkbox marked "<strong>Is Trigger.</strong>"</li>
<li>With <strong>AI_Character </strong>(red enemy tank) selected in the Hierarchy, notice in the Inspector it has a <strong>Touch </strong>script that has a "<strong>Target Affiliation</strong>" property dropdown. Choose "<strong>Player</strong>" in that dropdown.</li>
</ol>
